## Usage

### Main Screen

- Tap on any cell in the 9x9 grid to select it.
- Use the number buttons (1-9) below the grid to input digits.
- Press **Reset** to clear the grid and start fresh.
- Press **Submit** to solve the puzzle. If the grid is unsolvable or invalid, the app will display an error message.

### Theme Support

## Code Structure

### Key Components:

- **MainActivity.java**: This file contains the core logic for the app, including handling user input, solving the puzzle, and resetting the grid.
  
  Key Methods:
  - `handleSudokuDigits(Button clickedButton)`: Highlights selected buttons and inputs digits.
  - `resetGrid()`: Resets the Sudoku grid to the default state.
  - `solveSudoku()`: Utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
  - `validateInput()`: Checks the validity of the grid input and ensures there are no conflicting numbers.
  
  The algorithm efficiently fills the empty cells while checking for errors like duplicate numbers in the same row, column, or sub-grid.

## Backtracking Algorithm

The **backtracking algorithm** employed is a recursive method to fill the Sudoku grid while adhering to Sudoku rules. It tries numbers from 1 to 9 for each empty cell and backtracks when an invalid number is placed.

**How it works:**
1. Start with the first empty cell.
2. Try placing digits from 1-9.
3. Check for conflicts in the row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid.
4. If no conflict, move to the next cell.
5. If conflicts occur, backtrack to the previous cell and try a new number.

## Error Handling

The app is built to ensure no invalid Sudoku configuration is allowed:
- **Conflicting Rows/Columns**: Detects and prevents duplicate numbers in the same row or column.
- **Invalid Input**: Prompts the user with error messages for improper inputs.
- **Unsolvable Puzzle**: If the puzzle is unsolvable, the app notifies the user.
